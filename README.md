## Summary
It uses more modern and better mechanisms for speech generation. Compared to the original Diff-SVC and OpenVPI fork, there are several advantages:
+ Support for RMVPE
+ Support for ReFlow and DDIM
+ Support for LYNXNet
+ Simplified configuration structure

## How to set it up
You can find out how to run this project on your machine in the [Wiki](https://github.com/Yasuo414/onnx4144-s-Diffusion/wiki). Honestly, if I wrote everything down here, there would be no need for the [Wiki](https://github.com/Yasuo414/onnx4144-s-Diffusion/wiki).
